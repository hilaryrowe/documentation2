# Understanding the Digital Readiness Index

Understanding a customer’s digital readiness is critical to helping them in their digital transformation and to recommending the right Sight Machine products. An integral part of our engagement model is using the Digital Readiness Index \(DRI\), a methodology that Sight Machine uses to evaluate a manufacturer’s readiness for digital transformation and identify the projects likely to deliver the most impact.

Through our work with Fortune Global 500 \(or G500\) manufacturers, we have determined the main success factors critical for digital transformation. You can use DRI to identify which essential organizational and technical assets an enterprise customer already has in place, as well as provide the customer with a roadmap for prioritizing plants, building capabilities, and benchmarking against peers.

DRI is also a valuable framework that you can use to help manage customer expectations and set achievable goals that will add value for the customer.

There are two components \(or measurements\) to our Digital Readiness Index:

* **Organizational Readiness \(or Y axis\):** Does your customer have the necessary institutional support to begin the digital transformation?

* **Technical Readiness \(or X axis\): **Does your customer have the right IT infrastructure in place to be successful?
