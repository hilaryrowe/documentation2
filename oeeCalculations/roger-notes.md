  * Piece per pair


Availability = “a percentage measure of the degree to which machinery and equipment is in an operable and committable state at the point in time when it is needed.”1

Classifications to consider:

* Instantaneous \(or Point\) Availability.
* Average Up-Time Availability \(or Mean Availability\).
* Steady State Availability.
* Inherent Availability.
* Achieved Availability.

**Operational Availability.**

* A0=Uptime\/OperatingCycle

* Logistics Time

* Ready Time

* Waiting\/Administrative Downtime

* Preventive Maintence Downtime

* Corrective Maintence Downtime



## Notes from John Sun

Multiple Calculator Plugins

* Base
* Part based = Flyknit
* Parallel based = OSC Knife
* Skip Bad = 3D, MSP
* Line Stats = Auto No Sew...

## Base Formulas

Availability = sec cycles \/ exp cycles

Performance = mean ideal cycle time \/ mean cycle time

Quality = \# of defects\/ \# of output
