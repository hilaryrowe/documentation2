## **Availability Calculation**

The Availability component of OEE measures the ratio of expected operation time \(Expected Cycle Seconds\) to observed operation time \(Cycle Seconds\). This calculation shows the resulting percentage that the asset \(machine, line, or facility\) is actually operational compared to the planned operating time of the asset over a specific time horizon \(shift, daily, weekly, or monthly\).

**Availability Formula**

Availability is a percentage between 0% and 100% with 100% being the value when an asset is operating for exactly the expected run time. Using the components of Availability \(Expected Cycle Seconds and Cycle Seconds\) we can further explain how this is computed.
