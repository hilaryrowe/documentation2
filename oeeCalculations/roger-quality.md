## **Quality Calculation**

The Availability component of OEE measures the ratio of scheduled operation time \(Scheduled Time\) to observed operation time \(Available Time\). This calculation shows the resulting percentage that the asset \(machine, line, or facility\) is actually operational compared to the planned operating time of the asset over a specific time horizon \(shift, daily, weekly, or monthly\).
