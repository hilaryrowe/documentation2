## **Quality Calculation**

The Quality component of OEE measures the inverse of the ratio of defective output \(Defect Items\) to the total units of output \(Total Output\) or the yield of production passing inspection\/quality standards. This calculation shows the resulting percentage that the asset \(machine, line, or facility\) is producing quality output over a specific time horizon \(shift, daily, weekly, or monthly\).

**Quality Formula**

Quality is a percentage between 0% and 100% with 100% being the value when an asset is operating with perfect output quality or no defects. Using the components of Quality \(Defect Items and Total Output\) we can further explain how this is computed.

### **Defect Items**

Ideal Cycle time is fixed for a particular asset \(Machine Type based\) or variable based on the output being created \(Recipe based\) in milliseconds.
