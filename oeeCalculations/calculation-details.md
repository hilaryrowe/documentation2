# Default Formulas for OEE Metrics

## Availability

Sigma(Cycle Seconds) / Sigma(Expected Cycle Seconds)

## Performance == Operating

Mean Ideal Cycle Time / Mean Cycle Time

## Quality

Number of Defects (one entry could contain N defects) / Sigma(Output)

## OEE

Availability x Performance x Quality

## Output

Sigma(Cycle Output)
