Availability = “a percentage measure of the degree to which machinery and equipment is in an operable and committable state at the point in time when it is needed.”[^1]

Classifications to consider:

* Instantaneous \(or Point\) Availability.
* Average Up-Time Availability \(or Mean Availability\).
* Steady State Availability.
* Inherent Availability.
* Achieved Availability.
* **Operational Availability. **

  * $$A0 = Uptime / Operating Cycle$$

## **Availability Calculation**

The Availability component of OEE measures the ratio of scheduled operation time \(Scheduled Time\) to observed operation time \(Available Time\). The resulting calculation shows the percentage that the asset \(machine, line, or facility\) is actually operational compared to the planned operating time of the asset over a specific time horizon \(shift, daily, weekly, or monthly\).
