Availability = “a percentage measure of the degree to which machinery and equipment is in an operable and committable state at the point in time when it is needed.”[^1]

Classifications to consider:

* Instantaneous \(or Point\) Availability.
* Average Up-Time Availability \(or Mean Availability\).
* Steady State Availability.
* Inherent Availability.
* Achieved Availability.
* **Operational Availability. **

  * $$A0 = Uptime / Operating Cycle$$

## **Availability Calculation**

The Availability component of OEE measures the ratio of scheduled operation time \(Scheduled Time\) to observed operation time \(Available Time\). The resulting calculation shows the percentage that the asset \(machine, line, or facility\) is actually operational compared to the planned operating time of the asset over a specific time horizon \(shift, daily, weekly, or monthly\).

**Availability Formula**

Looking into the subcomponents of Availability \(Available Time, Scheduled Time\) we can add additional detail to how this is computed.



**Scheduled Time**

Scheduled time is a predefined operating schedule specified for a particular asset. This can be expressed more generally as the  total expected run time less any periods of time where the asset is not expected to be running \(planned downtime\).
