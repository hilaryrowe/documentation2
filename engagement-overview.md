Sight Machine is a real-time manufacturing data analytics platform that empowers manufacturers to take advantage of big data to solve operational challenges. Our platform helps customers rapidly achieve process improvement in a variety of quality, productivity, and visibility use cases by making better, faster decisions both on the plant floor and throughout the enterprise.

As a Sight Machine partner, you can guide enterprise customers in determining how best to leverage the platform in their individual manufacturing environments, and enable them to use manufacturing analytics as both a software and a framework for process improvement.

This guide will help you understand how the platform’s architecture works, as well as provide you with the tools you need to evaluate your customer’s current readiness for a digital transformation engagement.
