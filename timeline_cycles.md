# Viewing the Cycle

When you select and move the Cycle selector in the Timeline View, the Cycle View in the lower half of the pane changes to reflect the machine details for that cycle.

Use the Cycle View's slider bar in the far right side of the pane to scroll up and down to view information for all the machines in that cycle.
