   Filter your data further by selecting a different machine, date and time, and Shift from the Filter bar.
   
   Sort table data in ascending or descending order by selecting a column with an up/down arrow icon and clicking it. For example, click the up arrow in the Start Time column header to display all rows sorted by earliest start time to latest.
   
   **Note:** If there is a machine image associated with a row, an Attachment icon appears in the far left column. Clicking the Attachment icon displays the image with its associated table row highlighted. You can download the images(s) in a compressed file. Or, you can click the image(s) one at a time to display a larger view and download one image at a time.
