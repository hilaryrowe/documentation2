# Using DRI to Assess Product/Application Fit

The DRI assessment tool helps customers map their strengths and weaknesses, and thereby gain a better understanding of which projects deliver immediate value and where they should invest in building advanced capabilities.

In mapping our own customers, we found that their plants cluster in five areas along the readiness axes. We refer to these clusters as Digital Readiness Index Zones.

Each of the five DRI Zones contains several typical attributes that consequently identify in-scope projects as well as areas for future development.
