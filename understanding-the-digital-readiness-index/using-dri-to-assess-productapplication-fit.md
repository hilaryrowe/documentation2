# Using DRI to Assess Product and Application Fit

The DRI assessment tool helps customers map their strengths and weaknesses, and thereby gain a better understanding of which projects deliver immediate value and where they should invest in building advanced capabilities.

Each of the five DRI Zones contains several typical attributes that consequently identify in-scope projects as well as areas for future development.
