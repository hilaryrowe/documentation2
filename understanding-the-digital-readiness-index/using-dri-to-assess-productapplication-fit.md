# Using DRI to Assess Product and Application Fit

The DRI assessment tool helps customers map their strengths and weaknesses, and thereby gain a better understanding of which projects deliver immediate value and where they should invest in building advanced capabilities.

Through our work with Fortune Global 500 \(or G500\) manufacturers, we have determined the main success factors essential for digital transformation. We found that plants tend to cluster in five areas along the two readiness axes, which we refer to as Digital Readiness Index Zones.

Each of the five DRI Zones contains several typical attributes that consequently identify in-scope projects as well as areas for future development.

## Where Does the Customer Fit In?

Understanding which DRI zone the customer fits in does not mean that you are limited to suggesting only in-scope projects. Rather, the Digital Readiness Index Zone attributes help you understand the prerequisites the customer will need to work on, which is critical for helping you establish realistic budget and timeline expectations. Based on this knowledge, you can help determine which of our Sight Machine products and/or applications make the most sense to recommend.
