# Understanding the Organizational Readiness Axis

DRI’s Organizational Readiness axis measures whether a customer has the institutional support needed by evaluating factors such as commitment, budget, and staffing. You can use this information to determine the capability for new infrastructure and the likelihood of successful adoption.

Organizational Readiness consists of three categories:

* **Commitment and Budget: **For a large project to succeed, the customer requires buy-in from staff at many levels \(e.g., machine operator, plant manager, executive management, and IT\). In addition, the customer must have sufficient budget available, both for upgrading the underlying infrastructure \(e.g., networking\) and for the analytics project itself.

* **Skills and Resourcing: **We have categorized the main staff members needed for digitization projects. These include, for example, subject matter experts, data scientists, and change management experts who can implement the identified improvements.

* **Change Management: **To capture the value opportunities identified by analytics, the customer needs the right leadership in place to implement process, staff, and product changes.

To determine a customer’s readiness from an organizational standpoint, complete the following assessment with the necessary stakeholders.

Considering the responses to the assessment, you can determine how prepared the customer is organizationally, and suggest appropriate next steps. For more information, see [Managing Customer Expectations](/understanding-the-digital-readiness-index/managing-customer-expectations.md).
