# Understanding the Technical Readiness Axis

DRI’s Technical Readiness axis measures the customer’s technical landscape by evaluating data, policy, and knowledge infrastructure.

Technical Readiness consists of three sub-categories:

* **Data Connectivity and Accessibility: **This measures the availability and breadth of data, a fundamental requirement for any digital transformation project. It is important to find out if the machines have sensors, if they are networked, and whether data is flowing into a system of record or database. To enable more sophisticated analytics, part serial numbers or batch numbers with timestamps should be captured at each process step.

* **Cloud and Security Strategy:** It is important to ask if the data is remotely and securely accessible, if the customer has an existing strategy for working with cloud providers, and if there are any special requirements to segregate sensitive data, such as classified, ITAR, or HIPAA data.

* **Data Awareness: **The customer should have existing documentation or expertise to interpret the data coming from the machines and understand how it maps to the physical process.

To determine a customer’s technical readiness, complete the following assessment with the necessary stakeholders.

**Technical Readiness Assessment**

Considering the responses to the assessment, you can determine how prepared the customer is technologically, and suggest appropriate next steps. For more information, see [Managing Customer Expectations](/understanding-the-digital-readiness-index/managing-customer-expectations.md).
