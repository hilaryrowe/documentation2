## Where Does the Customer Fit In?

Understanding which readiness zone the customer fits in does not mean that you are limited to suggesting only in-scope projects. Rather, the Digital Readiness Index Zone attributes help you understand the prerequisites the customer will need to work on, which is critical for helping you establish realistic budget and timeline expectations. Based on this knowledge, you can help determine which of our Sight Machine products and/or applications make the most sense to recommend.
