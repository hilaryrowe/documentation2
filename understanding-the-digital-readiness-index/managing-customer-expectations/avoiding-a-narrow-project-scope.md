## Avoiding a Narrow Project Scope

Whenever possible, steer the customer toward a wider project scope. Promising to resolve a single issue or provide a solution for a unique error that is not repeatable will not have as much impact on the digital transformation of the enterprise as a whole. Instead, work with the customer to find a solution that, even at limited scope, can be used to understand and solve many types of issues that will improve the entire enterprise. Through the data analysis, our manufacturing analytics platform can be used to find that interesting and much-needed improvement.

Consider the following issues that arise if the project scope is too narrow:

* **Testing the Technology \(i.e., Explaining Something Known\): **The customer finds an issue and works internally to resolve it \(sometimes using manual, one-off fixes\). The customer now wants our Sight Machine Data Science team to analyze the data to come up with the exact same solution to prove that the platform works. The problem is that the customerâ€™s original solution was a patchwork, based on too many factors that we may not be able to replicate.

* **Validating Against Hunches \(i.e., Explaining Someone's Guess\): **This is similar to the hypothetical situation above, but this time the customer has not clearly identified and resolved the problem. Instead, the customer has a hunch and wants our Sight Machine team to analyze data to confirm that bias. In this situation, the data may not actually confirm the hunch.
