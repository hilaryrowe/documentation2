# Configuring an OPC UA Plugin

The customer may have data from OPC UA sources.

OPC Unified Architecture \(OPC UA\) is a machine-to-machine communication protocol for industrial automation that provides a secure and reliable mechanism for moving data between enterprise-type systems and the kinds of controls, monitoring devices, and sensors that interact with real-world data.

The most important enhancement from classic OPC to the newer OPC UA is that OPC UA does not rely on Microsoft technology \(OLE or DCOM\) so it can be implemented on any platform \(Apple, Linux, Windows\). In addition, UA makes it possible to use structures or models so data tags or points can be grouped and given context to simplify system management and maintenance.
