# Process Control
 
 The Process Control display model is one of the four visual data displays on the Analysis Tab. Process Control uses statistical quality control methods to monitor your machine processes. 

 Process control, and the Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart, is about separating variance into special cause from common cause. 
 
  * common cause: natural, random motion or "noise‚Äù
  * special cause: outliers or anomalies, such as tool wear, a sudden shift in way an operator performs the job, etc.
