# Process Control
 
 The Process Control display model is one of the four visual data displays on the Analysis Tab. Process Control uses statistical quality control methods to monitor your machine processes. 

 All production processes have variance in them. For example, every time a machine cuts a part there will always be some fluctuation. The goal is not to have zero variance, but to understand variance at a slightly different level.
 
 Process improvement is the goal to minimize the process variance as much as possible. Before you can improve a process or its variance, you need to know how much of the variance is due to common cause or special cause.
 
  * common cause: natural, random motion or "noise‚Äù
  * special cause: outliers or anomalies, such as tool wear, a sudden shift in way an operator performs the job, etc.
