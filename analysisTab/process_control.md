# Process Control
 
 The Process Control display model is one of the four visual data displays on the Analysis Tab. Process Control uses statistical quality control methods to monitor your machine processes. 

 All production processes have variance in them. The goal is not to have zero variance but to understand it at a slightly different level. Every time a machine cuts a part there will always be some fluctuation. 
 
 Process improvement to minimize the variance as much as possible. Before you can improve a process or its variance, you need to know how much of the variance's cause is due to:
 
  * common cause: natural, random motion or "noise”
  * special cause: outliers or anomalies, such as tool wear, a sudden shift in way an operator performs the job, etc.  
 
 Process control is 
 —separate special cause from common cause: fundamentally all you’re doing with a Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart.
