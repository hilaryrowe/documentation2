# Understanding SPC with Sight Machine

  All production processes have variance in them. For example, every time a machine cuts a part there will always be some fluctuation. The goal is not to have zero variance, but to understand variance at a slightly different level.
 
 Process improvement is the goal to minimize the process variance as much as possible. Before you can improve a process or its variance, you need to know how much of the variance is due to common cause or special cause.
