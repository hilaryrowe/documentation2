# Understanding SPC with Sight Machine

The Statistical Process Control \(SPC\) chart separates special cause variance from common cause variance. In Sight Machine, you select a machine on which to run the Process Control algorithms, a variable to analyze, and other filters. Results show special cause variance, thresholds for the special cause variance, and range.
