# Understanding SPC with Sight Machine

  
 
 The Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart separates special cause variance from common cause variance. In Sight Machine, you select a machine on which to run the Process Control algorithms, a variable to analyze, and other filters. 
 



does a few things
on left name of machine/out of control (means on stat control it found some kind of that special cause variance—not normal); the way we determine is apply Nelson’s rules—wiki page is good; a way to detect anomolies/trends/quirks in data—classic “is there a point more than 3 standard deviations from the mean”—there interesting rules looking for other strange problems; see screen shot—other items listed are add’l thressholds there; looking for drifts or other unusual patterns in the data an notifying them to user

bar chart taking a little slice of time of prod data and avg those points in time and then plotting those averages on this chart; each point is not a point of prod. data, it’s a point of prd. that happened aggregating by one hour intervals…aggregating that…gets into the central limit theorem and forcing everyone

avg over that period of time

average
