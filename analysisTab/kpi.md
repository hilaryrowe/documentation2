# Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
  
  The KPI graph allows you to chart KPIs over time and shifts, and compare KPIs across machines, machine types, and factories.
   Key performance indicators (KPI) are a measurement of performance. In Sight Machine, performance measures are defined and then configured by your organization. The KPI Pareto chart on the Analysis tab is one view into your manufacturing downtime (performance). You can view this data by category, reason, or shift.
