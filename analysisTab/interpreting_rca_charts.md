# Interpreting RCA Charts

 When you run the RCA in Sight Machine, it goes through all your data and does all the regression analysis for you to set it up and select variables.
 
 For example, if you want to study availability on the Carmel - Assembly 1 in the example below, a first pass filter is applied through the whole set of all the variables in the data set related to the Carmel machine. A lot of that data is highly correlated. Some variables may not vary within the data set. Theory tools and techniques are applied o filter down that list of variables. Eight variables display on the RCA chart, but on the Data Tab there may be 50 variables. This first pass filter analyzes and throws out data that is not likely to be a predictor of availability.

Then a regression analysis is run. Regression analysis estimates the links among variables. In the left-hand side chart, the dashed line indicates the cut off to separate variables that are likely and not likely to be significant. Those variables displayed above are likely significant  below line are not likely to be stat isgnivican and above are stat significant—we show results but
