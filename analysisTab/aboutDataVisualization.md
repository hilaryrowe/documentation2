# About Data Visualization

  Data Visualization is a picture of your data. Sight Machine takes all inputs from your manufacturing process and displays that "picture" graphically. Graph data is easier to read and consume, and it allows you to better understand your manufacturing process. With that information in hand, you can make informed choices and improve manufacturing efficiency.
