# Setting Up Network Configuration \(Advanced\)

FactoryTX will be easiest to deploy when you are using DHCP \(automatic network configuration\) over a wired Ethernet connection and you have access to external IPs. If this is the case, you can use the same deployment image/USB to deploy multiple devices.

If you are running a Virtual Machine, default network settings are usually sufficient, assuming that the host OS is already on the correct network. You can make any advanced or specific settings within the VM manager \(e.g., VirtualBox or VMWare\).
