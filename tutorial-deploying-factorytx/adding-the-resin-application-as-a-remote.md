`# `Adding the Resin Application as a Remote

You need to add the Resin application as a remote inside your deployment Git repository.

**To add the Resin application as a remote:**

1. In the upper-right of the Resin.io maintenance page, there is a snippet to add the remote application to your Git repository.  
   ![](/tutorial-deploying-factorytx/Adding Resin Application as Remote1 w Lines.png)

2. Copy this text, and then add it as a remote inside your deployment Git repository.  
   **`cd factorytx2`**  
   **`git remote add resin <your Resin user name>@git.resin.io:<your Resin user name>/<your Resin application name>.git`**

3. To check if you did this correctly, you can list your remotes:  
   **`Â± % git remote -v origin git@github.com:sightmachine/factorytx2.git (fetch)    `**`  
   `**`origin git@github.com:sightmachine/factorytx2.git (push)    `**`  
   `**`resin <your Resin name>@git.resin.io:<your Resin name>/<your Resin application name>.git (fetch)    `**`  
   `**`resin <your Resin name>@git.resin.io:<your Resin name>/<your Resin application name>.git (push)`**

   **NOTE: **This effectively means you can push code to two different remote locations: origin, which is the GitHub repository for committing changes back to Sight Machine, or "resin," which will execute a build pipeline and automatically update all the devices in that application with the new software.
