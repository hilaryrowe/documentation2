# Setting Up Remote Debugging

Resin devices allow you to view of logs from the device, as well as SSH into the device, to debug.

There are also command-line interface \(CLI\) tools available if you prefer not to use the web interface. For more information, see: [https://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/](https://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/)

**NOTE: **For Resin CLI to use SSH and logs, you will need to edit your SSH configuration to have the following directive:

`Host *.resindevice.io`

  ` IdentityFile ~/.ssh/SSH_IDENTITY_KEY_FOR_RESIN`

**To set up remote debugging:**

1. Click the name of a device in the list to select it.
