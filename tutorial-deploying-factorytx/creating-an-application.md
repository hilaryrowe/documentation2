# Creating an Application

Applications are specific to a given customer and deployment target \(VM vs. NUC\).

**To create an application:**

1. When you log in to Resin, the Applications page displays all running applications for that Resin.io instance, including their current status \(offline, updating, live, etc.\).

   If you do not have any current applications, the Applications page will be empty.

2. In the upper-left corner, in the Device Type drop-down menu, select one of the following endpoints:

   * **NUC**

   * **QMU X86 64bit**

3. Under Application Name, type a name. The general naming scheme for an application will be: customerRepoDevice. Spaces and special characters are not allowed, so camel case is preferred. For example: FtxQemu
