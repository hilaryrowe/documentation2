# Understanding the FactoryTX Interface {#docs-internal-guid-92afc525-66cc-fd30-3c17-d9363746a63c}

The FactoryTX interface provides a way to view, edit, and save changes to the three sections of the configuration file source code:

* Data Receiver

* Transforms

* Data Transmit

For more details about those three elements, see [Configurations in FactoryTX](/configurations-in-factorytx.md).

## Editing the Configuration

The Configuration section of FactoryTX allows you to view the FTX configuration file, as well as access other features.
