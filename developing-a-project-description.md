# Developing a Project Description {#docs-internal-guid-ccf9fe01-d6e6-b9d4-7962-8b097685fe40}

You are responsible for creating a detailed project description for the implementation team to follow. Later, the Sight Machine teams will use this description to develop the projectâ€™s statement of work.

The project description should include sections such as:

* Introduction/Executive Overview

* Objectives

* Risk Factors or Concerns

* Key Contacts

* Process Details \(e.g., Industry Overview, Line/Process Mapping\)

* Information About the Data \(e.g., Connectivity and Data Sources\)

* Sample Data Exploration \(e.g., File Exploration, Data Model Alignment\)

You can refer to the [Sample Project Description](/developing-a-project-description/sample-project-description.md) for more information.
