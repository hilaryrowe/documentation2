### Questions to Ask the Customer {#docs-internal-guid-1eff3eca-e663-3701-f363-a83d29d16a32}

At the start of the engagement, you and the implementation team may want to ask the customer the following questions:

* What is the overarching initiative with which this effort is associated?

* What is the driving use case for the datasets and site\(s\)?

* Are there any assumptions around what is the primary driver of issues to explore?

* Is there a process flow available?

* How long does it take to move from raw material to finished product?

* How long are each of the process steps?

* Can the start and end of a process step be identified in the data provided? How?

* What are the data sources that will be used?

* Can we receive sample data? What period of time will it cover?

* How do these data sources relate to the various assets?

* Are there manual data capture steps? Where are those in the process?

* In what format will the data be provided?

* How can the data be joined/assembled together? Are you doing this now? How?

* Is there an SME/process/automation engineer available to assist with any questions that may arise regarding the data or the process?

* What are identifiers that can track the batch throughout the process?

* Is there an identifier that can be used to track back to supplier?

* Are there different types of quality issues that arise? If so, are these identified in the data?

* Are there particular downtime or stop issues that are notable? How are they captured and coded? How are they currently used?

* Is there supplemental information that exists outside of the line that might be relevant in diagnosing the cause of the downtime and quality issues \(e.g., environmental factors\)?
