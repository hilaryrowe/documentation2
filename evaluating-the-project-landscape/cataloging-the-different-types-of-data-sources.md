# Cataloging the Different Types of Data Sources

You will work with the customerâ€™s internal resources to determine the various data sources used throughout the manufacturing process. Inquire about all of the following:

* **Real-Time Data Sources: **Examples include data directly from sensors and programmable logic controllers \(PLCs\), images from cameras, worker IDs and shift codes gathered at time of operation from scheduling systems, supplier data, etc.

* **Archive Data Sources: **Examples include historians and databases. Computer-based data sources may store their data here, in a time series format or organized by material or asset.

* **File-Based Data Sources: **Examples include Excel spreadsheet outputs, log files from computer programs, unstructured data sources like images or G-code files, etc. This is often data produced as part of the assembly line process but which is not currently being interpreted.

* **Application Programming Interfaces \(APIs\): **Examples include product data such as serial codes pulled from legacy Manufacturing Execution System \(MES\)/Factory Information Systems \(FIS\) and enterprise resource planning \(ERP\) solutions, and other systems of records that we can integrate with directly.
