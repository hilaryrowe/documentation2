## Building a Customer Value Map {#docs-internal-guid-1eff3eca-d6e3-8b28-a0d3-454ddea12f0e}

An important step in evaluating the project landscape is creating a customer value map. This valuable tool helps you set project milestones and informs the order of the implementation plan. For instance, how far do you have to get through the implementation plan in order to provide value to the customer? 

The map contains the following columns to help you visualize the value:

* **Task: **This column lists items that will be in the implementation plan, prioritized from easiest/fastest to accomplish to most difficult/time consuming.

* **Customer Value: **This column lists improvements or changes that the customerâ€™s stakeholders view as important, listed from most to least important.

You can draw a connection from each task to each customer value to determine when the most value will be provided during the implementation process.

Consider the two examples below, which list identical tasks and customer values. The tasks are listed in the order that the implementation team prefers, but depending on which tasks are attainable \(yellow\) and which are not \(grey\), you may have to guide the customer toward reprioritizing their value list.

**Customer Value Map Example 1**

In this example, it is clear that customer values 3 and 4 are the most realistic.

**Customer Value Map Example 2**

In this example, customer values 1 and 2 are more appropriate.
