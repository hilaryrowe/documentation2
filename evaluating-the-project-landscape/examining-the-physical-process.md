# Examining the Physical Process

Start your plant examination by gathering existing diagrams—or creating new diagrams—of the customer’s manufacturing process at each applicable factory, plant, or division. The diagrams should include details such as the following:

* A graphical flowchart showing each step of the physical process at each plant

* Lists of all the data sources generated during each process at each plant

**Sample Physical Process Diagram**

### Evaluation Meeting Resource

As a reference, please see[General Data Requirements and Process Questions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hilaryrowe1/sight-machine-partner-documentation/edit#). You can copy and customize this document for the customer and give it to stakeholders as part of the data evaluation meeting.

### Questions to Ask the Customer {#docs-internal-guid-1eff3eca-e663-3701-f363-a83d29d16a32}

At the start of the engagement, you and the implementation team may want to ask the customer the following questions:

* What is the overarching initiative with which this effort is associated?

* What is the driving use case for the datasets and site\(s\)?

* Are there any assumptions around what is the primary driver of issues to explore?

* Is there a process flow available?

* How long does it take to move from raw material to finished product?

* How long are each of the process steps?

* Can the start and end of a process step be identified in the data provided? How?

* What are the data sources that will be used?

* Can we receive sample data? What period of time will it cover?

* How do these data sources relate to the various assets?

* Are there manual data capture steps? Where are those in the process?

* In what format will the data be provided?

* How can the data be joined/assembled together? Are you doing this now? How?

* Is there an SME/process/automation engineer available to assist with any questions that may arise regarding the data or the process?

* What are identifiers that can track the batch throughout the process?

* Is there an identifier that can be used to track back to supplier?

* Are there different types of quality issues that arise? If so, are these identified in the data?

* Are there particular downtime or stop issues that are notable? How are they captured and coded? How are they currently used?

* Is there supplemental information that exists outside of the line that might be relevant in diagnosing the cause of the downtime and quality issues \(e.g., environmental factors\)?
