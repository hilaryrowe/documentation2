# Examining the Physical Process

Start your plant examination by gathering existing diagrams—or creating new diagrams—of the customer’s manufacturing process at each applicable factory, plant, or division. The diagrams should include details such as the following:

* A graphical flowchart showing each step of the physical process at each plant

* Lists of all the data sources generated during each process at each plant
