# Line Operator Downtime Entry

A line operator might use a tablet to enter a single downtime at the same time it is detected. This real-time downtime entry does not require a working Internet connection. If the Internet connection goes down, the line operator will still be able to add downtime.

Consider the example of a line operator responsible for identifying machine downtime for a machine that produces lock mechanisms. If that machine goes down for any variety of reasons, that line operator would follow these instructions to record that machine's downtime.

**Note:** The images below are only examples and your tablet display will appear differently, with downtime reasons unique to your facility and product.

1.  Select a machine from the Machine drop-down list.
