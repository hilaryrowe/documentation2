# Automated Inspection

Sight Machine can create defects directly from automated inspection of machine data. If your machine can produce a signal to indicate detection of a defect, Sight Machine can track the detections automatically and generate defect models.

Each time a defect is reported by a machine's signal, it is automatically recorded in the Sight Machine application. These defects can include rich information, such as a picture of the defect, when something goes wrong. Sight Machine grabs that image along with any other captured data.

You can view auto-inspected defects as a summary from the Dashboard tab or in detail on the Data tab.
