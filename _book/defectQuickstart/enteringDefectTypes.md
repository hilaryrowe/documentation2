# How to Configure Defect Types

In order to identify defects in a way that can be measured, a manager at your organization must configure defect types in the Settings view. Once configured, these defect types are available throughout the Sight Machine application.

**Note:** Defect type configuration is limited to an organization's manager to ensure Sight Machine provides consistent and clear data. If anyone could add defect types on the fly, the opportunity for inconsistent data would increase, rendering the data meaningless. \(i.e. two or more employees might enter a different defect type for the same type of defect, making it difficult to ascertain the meaning of these different types.\)

The manager designated to configure defect types can enter as many defect types as needed for your organization.

Use the following instructions to configure a defect type in Sight Machine.

1.  Click the Gear icon in the Toolbar to display the Settings view.
2.  Click on the Machine Settings tab.

3.  Click the Defect Types button.
4.  Click the Code or Sub Code button to display the Add Defect Type dialog box.

    **Note:** If you are entering a defect type sub code, be sure to select a current code in the list of defect types first, in order to indicate to which code the sub code will be subordinate.

5.  Enter appropriate values in the fields and click Save. The defect type you just added displays in the list of defect types and throughout Sight Machine's tabs and workflows.
