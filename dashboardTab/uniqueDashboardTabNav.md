# Unique Dashboard Tab Navigation

On the Dashboard tab, data displays in two panes: 
  * OEE Pane

**OEE Pane**
In the OEE pane, overall equipment efficiency displays for the machine and time you selected in the Filter bar. Linked text in this pane allows navigation to other tabs where you can see more detailed information.
 
   * Clicking the OEE Over Time link takes you to the Analysis Tab
   * Clicking the Availability, Performance, or Quality linked text takes you to the Data Tab
   * Clicking any of the line graphs in the OEE OVer Time chart also takes you to the Data Tab

When you navigate to any of these other tabs, you must click the Update button upon arrival to see detailed information.

**Tabbed Pane**
In the Tabbed Pane, OEE is broken down into its component parts and displays them as *subtabs* display: Availability, Performance, Quality, and Output.
