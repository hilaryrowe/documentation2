# Batch Defect Entry

A manager or a QA lab technician might record multiple defects at a time after reviewing output at the end of a shift. For example, if it's your company's policy to check the first and last item of every batch, and discard an entire batch if that first and last item are defective, you'll use the cloud-based Sight Machine application's Data tab to enter all the defects at once.

The instructions below are steps for entering a batch of defects.

1.  On the Data tab, select Defects from the Update Menu to toggle the Resource toolbar \(upper right corner of the screen\) to display the Add \(+\) icon.
