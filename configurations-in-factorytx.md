## JSON Format for Configuration {#docs-internal-guid-f6e88102-66ee-3ade-affe-949c4d33a13e}

JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) is a lightweight data-interchange format. We use JSON as the format for the FTX configuration file. It is also the underlying programming of the SSLOG format that FTX transforms all data sources into before transmitting them to Sight Machine. For more information on SSLOG, see [Deep Dive into SSLOG](/deep-dive-into-sslog.md).

For specifics on the JSON syntax, refer to [http://json.org](http://json.org).
