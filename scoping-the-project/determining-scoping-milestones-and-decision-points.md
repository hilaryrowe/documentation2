# Determining Scoping Milestones and Decision Points

In any engagement, it is important to agree with the customer upon realistic milestones and decision points. Think of the milestones as the various deliverables from the statement of work, while the decision points are the dates tied to those milestones.

You will be responsible for holding onsite meetings with the customer aimed at helping them solve particular problems or issues using Sight Machine products. You should ask thorough questions of the customer to fully understand what their specific manufacturing concerns are. Your goals should be the following:

* To define the scope of the project

* To define how the team will measure the success of the project

* To show how Sight Machine product features can help resolve the defined problems

During the stages of the implementation process, you will assess whether or not various items fit within the project scope as well as how much effort or customization they would require.

The stages you should consider include:

* **Data Intake: **Make the assessment after evaluating data and building the customer value map.

* **Data Modeling: **Risks may not be revealed until after data intake but, to every extent possible, evaluate what you see.

You should evaluate the risks and categorize situations as the following:

* **In-Product Fast Installation: **These are items that fit well within the scope and offer few impediments to success. Overall, data is well-organized and easy to ingest. These items should comprise the first set of milestones, and generally will be in scope for an EMV/EMA project.

* **Fee-Based Data Preparation and Modeling Services: **These are items that we should probably not undertake as part of the project because of the complexity involved. Usually, these items involve a high level of customer and sometimes vendor involvement, both of which add time and cost to the project. All of these items should be discussed with the customer in the context of DRI as being out of scope for the project.

* **Not Ready For Digital Transformation:** These are items that have high complexity and would need to be negotiated with the customer, usually as part of the professional services agreement. Beware that this is usually where projects become overly complicated and run aground.
