# Using the Asset Picker
 The Asset Picker is the left-hand menu option that lets you select an asset, or machine, for which you want to view data. The example below is an image of the Asset Picker as it appears on the Dashboard tab.

* Choose how you select your asset by clicking one of the Asset Picker views: Locations, Types, or Labels. 
* Click the expand or contract arrows to display/hide all the options within that view.
* Select an asset radio button to close the Asset Picker and display the data for the selected machine.

The Asset Picker appears the same for the Dashboard, Data, and Timeline tabs. 

More options display in the Asset Picker on the Analysis tab.
