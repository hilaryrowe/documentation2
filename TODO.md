__Ideas and improvements for this repo__

- Enable slack integration (needs Jenkins plugin upgrade)
- Per branch pipeline for branch -> stage -> production
- Chef based deploy?
- Upgrade our documentation Gitbook from 2.6.7 -> 3.2.0 (currently does not work for functional notation + search)
- Deploy validations should check for more than status code, git sha perhaps?
