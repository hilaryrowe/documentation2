### Sample Data Exploration

#### File Exploration

Example questions to ask of the data:

1. What is the general structure of the data? \(show with Jupyter\)

2. How many rows? Columns?

3. Any noticeable issues with the data?

4. Is there a cycle boundary field? How would we identify it?

5. Output count definition

6. Serial Numbers/Batch Numbers

7. Downtime Indicators

8. Defect Codes

9. Downtime Codes

**EXAMPLE: {File 1} Data Exploration**

* Link to Jupyter Notebook Exploration \(HTML version\)

* 00-DownSample-Dataset.ipynb

**EXAMPLE: {File 2} Data Exploration**

* Link to Jupyter Notebook Exploration \(HTML version\)

* 01-Next-logical-step.ipynb



Please note the sequentially numbered notebook name in the exploration, e.g., 01-Next-logical-step.ipynb. This helps to ensure that another person could follow behind you in a logical order and rerun the datasets to recreate your data findings.
