# Machine Timeline
 
  The Timeline tab shows machine operating and down times for specified machines and dates. There are two horizontal views: 
  
  * A top pane that shows machine availability for a 24-hour shift cycle 
  * A lower pane that shows a small subset of that 24-hour shift and specific part function
