# How to Configure Downtime Reasons

In order to identify downtime in a way that can be measured, a manager at your organization must configure downtime reasons in the Settings view. Once configured, these downtime reasons are available throughout the Sight Machine application.

**Note:** Downtime reason configuration is limited to an organization's manager to ensure Sight Machine provides consistent and clear data. If anyone could add downtime reasons on the fly, the opportunity for inconsistent data would increase, rendering the data meaningless. \(i.e. two or more employees might enter a different downtime reason for the same type of downtime, making it difficult to ascertain the meaning of these different reasons.\)

The manager designated to configure downtime reasons can enter as many downtime reasons as needed for your organization.

Use the following instructions to configure a downtime reason in Sight Machine.

1.  Click the Gear icon in the Toolbar to display the Settings view.
2.  Click on the Machine Settings tab.

3.  Click the Downtime Reasons button.
4.  Click the Code or Sub Code button to display the Add Downtime Reason dialog box.

    **Note:** If you are entering a downtime reason sub code, be sure to select a current code in the list of downtime reasons first, in order to indicate to which code the sub code will be subordinate.

5.  Enter appropriate values in the fields and click Save. The downtime reason you just added displays in the list of downtime reasons and throughout Sight Machine's tabs and workflows.
