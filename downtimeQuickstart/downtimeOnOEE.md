# Downtime Data on the Dashboard \(OEE\) Tab

Machine downtime appears as a Pareto chart on the Dashboard tab's Availability subtab. Use the following steps to refine and view downtime metrics from the Dashboard tab.

**Note:** The Availability subtab may be labeled differently than in the image below, and instead have a unique name specific to your organization.

1.  In the Update pane, select a manufacturing site and machine from the site picker.
