# Automated Inspection

Sight Machine can create downtime entries directly from automated inspection of machine data. If your machine can produce a signal to indicate detection of downtime, Sight Machine can track the detections automatically and generate downtime models.

Each time downtime is reported by a machine's signal, it is automatically recorded in the Sight Machine application.

**Note:** Auto-tracking of downtime can take place only when Sight Machine is running.

You can view auto-inspected downtime as a summary from the Dashboard tab, which includes links to more detailed information on the Analysis, Data, and Timeline tabs.

## Auto-Detected Downtime on the Dashboard Tab

The Operational plot and subtab on the Dashboard tab provide a high-level view of auto-detected downtime.
